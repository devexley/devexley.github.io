      Asking a question is difficult.  It is even more difficult to ask a question which you anticipate has an answer.  Being specific, succinct, clear, and thorough are probably some of the hallmarks of asking a good question. Jon Skeet provides good advice in framing a question as one which you imagine you try to answer. Also important is to make sure you have exhausted all possibilities in your search for an answer before posing the question.  This not only narrows the question down but does not waste other people's time on questions you could have answered yourself with some research. 
    </p>
      The purpose of this is not to be vague and just ask "Why is this not working?".
      But be specific as to what problem the question is supposed to solve.  Therefore not only ask the question precisely but provide all the necessary information to make the question answerable.  This could include code but make sure the code duplicates the issue and only the issue and is complete otherwise without any extraneous details.  This focus will help you get the answer quicker.  Also important is to be grammatically correct to minimize misinterpretation of the question. 
    <p>
      I cannot think of any questions that I have asked but I am sure once I am on site I will be asking a lot.  On stack overflow the good questions seem to have the relevant tags for the questions, provide an accurate representation of the problem, note where the actual problem is occurring, and provide a context so that the question framework is clear regarding what is trying to be accomplished by the provided answer.  In other words, the question is clear, specific, contextual, and demonstrative of the problem to which you seek an answer.
