      Version Control allows the saving and tracking of changes to a project.  The value of this is that you can save incremental changes and revert back to earlier versions of your project if necessary.  This provides granular control over changes.  For a small project it may not be of noticeable use, but for a large project it will help keep things organized and changes logged in a retreivable manner.

        Git tracks any changes to a project locally on your computer.  Whatever you add or modify is tracked by git for versioning.  The changes are shown and then you can add them to a project for staging and when you have reviewed and want to accept the changes to your main (master) project, you commit the changes.  This allows you to keep the master project clean and free of issues while letting you test changes first before committing to keep them.

        The benefit of Git is that since all the changes are logged, you can always revert back to an earlier version.  In conjunction with GitHub, it also allows multiple people to work on the same project with out having lots of merge conflicts.
