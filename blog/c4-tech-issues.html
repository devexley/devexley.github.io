      Diversity in Tech is a problem that has yet to be properly addressed.  Examples of a lack of diversity include low female employment and under-representation of certain minorities in the tech field.  Although some statistics have been gathered, and attempts made to remedy the issue, it remains at this time an intractable problem for several reasons.
    </p>
      A major problem is the inertia of a system that has always undervalued women due to culture and gender bias.  Since men predominate the tech industry, there is a group mentality which gives men an advantage.  Also, women are seen as too feminine for the positions at higher levels which culturally are considered more masculine positions.  This puts women at a disadvantage because they must always try to prove themselves to be up to a stereotype. 
    <p>
      However there are things that can be done.  A good article about dealing with the issue of divesity in tech was published by the Harvard Business Review on <a href="https://hbr.org/2014/10/hacking-techs-diversity-problem">Tech Diversity</a>.  It outlines how to use metrics and Bias interrupters along with other solutions to help change the dynamic.  It seems like tech companies are more willing to acknowledge the diversity issue and the article provides concrete methods in how to address the situation.  Overall this could be a positive for the future of diversity in the tech field
