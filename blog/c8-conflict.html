      I tend to avoid conflict if I can.  This is probably not a good thing because it requires me to sacrifice my feelings or needs in favor of others.
    </p>
      If something is bothering me I usually let it go.  One instance where I did get upset was when my roommate was giving out my internet password to anybody who would come over even if I did not know them.  This I thought was unacceptable and let it go the first few times but got upset when it happened for the fifth time.  That time I spoke up and said to stop giving out the password. I felt bad about speaking up and did not do so angrily, but felt as if my roommate should have known better.
    <p>
      In hindsight, I should have mentioned this the first time and been clear that the password was something that should not be given out to people I do not know.  And I should have not assumed that my roomate knew why this would be a source of conflict.  
    </p>
      In the future, I should address the issue when it first arises instead of waiting as this could lead to confusion and me seeming arbitrary as to when I am upset about something.
