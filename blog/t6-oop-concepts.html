      Object-Oriented (OO) programming relies upon modeling by abstraction the state and behavior of an object into a single bundled data structure, or class.  For a simple example, if we take a ball it has a certain state such as color and size.  It also has behavior such as it can be thrown, bounced, and caught. In a sense OO mimics real-world objects in a programming context.  You write code that bundles the state(attributes) and behavior(methods) into a cohesive unit that is a blueprint for making that particular object.  The details are then abstracted and hidden behind an interface that allows access to their functionality through methods. In the ball example, you can create any number of balls of different shape and size that all can be thrown, bounced, or caught.  You can create many different object classes and they communicate with each other by passing messages to each other.  There is more, but this seems to be the core.

       Functional programming is modeled upon how a function operates.  There is an input and there is an output. Functional programming does not abstract to a data structure, but to a function. Functional programming is characterized by being immutable and stateless.  The immutable portion means that it shoud not change.  Stateless means that the function should not be affected or dependent upon anything beyond its input, which interestingly enough can be a function. Functional programming does not have to have a memory of what took place before.

        In reading and comparing these two it seems that they both have there differences.  OO is good for encapsulating attributes and methods into discrete units which can interact.  This can be helpful in a large program if done correctly by allowing easy maintenance and extendability.  Functional programming, since it loosely couples data and structure, is less prone to side-effects when data changes since it is a simple model of input and output and does not care beyond those for each function.  However it seems that OO can be more readable than functional because it tries to model on the world as objects.
