      Stereotype Threat is sort of a subconcious situational inadequacy due to a negative stereotype being contextually reinforced.  For instance, if your stereotype group is thought of as being intellectually inferior and you belong to that group, anything which highlights such a stereotype in an intellectual context will cause you to perform at less than your true ability.  In other words, if you are part of a group that is thought to be inferior in some way, you end up falling prey to those expectations whether you want to or not due to anxiety or other factors dampening your full cognitive capacity.

      I believe this to be a true phenomenon that is hard to quantify.  Although studies have been done, it is a difficult subject to gauge.  There are things that can be done about it.  One is try not to use negative stereotypes in situations.  Provide an environment conducive to bring out the best in all.

      I cannots say I have experienced stereotype threat personally but have felt some things akin to it.  However I can imagine how minorities and women are affected by a negative stereotype.  If women are considered bad at engineering, than they are less likely to go into engineering which is a waste of potential.  If minorities are considered to be less smart, a self-confirming bias will lead them to not seek challenging roles or do poorly in environments where there is a stereotype threat.
