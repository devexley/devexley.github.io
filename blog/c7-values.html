    <p>Compassion is something I value.  I try my best to practice it as it is tantamount to trying to understand someone else's position and emotionally relate to it.  It is a keystone I think of having a sense of humanity.  It is important to me because it helps you relate to people and their circumstances and provides perspective.
    </p>
    <p>I think this is one of the reasons people often tell me things or share there feelings with me because I am a compassionate listener, or at least try to be.  As a result, I'm rarely asked for specific advice, but provide advice through listening and understanding.  
        
    </p>
    <p>In thinking about the values I appreciate, compassion, truth, friendships, I realize that I cherish a sort of mutually supporting environment.  I think knowing that my cohort will be in the same situation is ameliorative and, if we can avoid stereotype threat and animosity, the experience will be rich and rewarding.      
    </p>
    <p>
      This will take great effort on my part to stay bouyant and not let negativity sabotage the experience as I am generally a pessimist and usually have that imposter feeling.  I'll try to remember it is a chance to learn as much as possible.
