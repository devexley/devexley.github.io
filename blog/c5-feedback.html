      Pairing is a key format to learning at DBC and is done with great frequency.  This is a good thing as you are able to see how other people think and try to work together to solve a problem.  After all two heads are better than one.  One thing negative I found myself doing was over preparing which in some ways defeats the purpose of pairing.  I learned not to do that as much to make the pairing session more rewarding.  I learned this through receiving feedback.

       Feedback can be difficult to get as it feels like criticism but ultimately helps you be a better pair.  Feedback is also difficult to provide as it has to be actionable, specific, and kind. The most difficult thing about providing feedback is trying to find out what could be done better.  As you pair more, you get a sense of how to pair and this becomes easier, but initially it is hard to give proper feedback.

       I think pairing and getting feedback is good as it helps in both learning and working in a team environment.  Coding is not necessarily a solo process and pairing helps to emphasize this.
