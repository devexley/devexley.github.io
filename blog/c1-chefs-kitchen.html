    <p>
      DBC is a very intensive experience and requires a lot of yourself.  I'm usually very solitary but think this would be a good program to be part of a learning community and be creative.  I hope to be able to contribute to the holistic program.
    </p>
    <p>
        My expectations have been changed somewhat as I realize I need to be more participatory.  This is difficult for me but I think I am up to the challenge.  
    </p>
    <p>
        I am nervous still for a variety of reasons.  Will I be good enough and learn fast enough.  I have to get over these fears and try to be as much a part of the program as I can to get the most out of it.  I look forward to the challenge.
