      "Ruby on Rails", a.k.a "Rails", was created by David Heinemeir Hansson for the project Basecamp and eventually released under MIT License. It is a web application framework for building websites based on the MVC (Model-View-Controller) model.  It is used in conjunction with Ruby, HTML, CSS, and Javascript.  
    </p>
      Its design is to make it easier to rapidly create web applications without an excess amount of configuration or decision-making.  As a result, Rails is considered to be "convention over configuration" language.  It uses a specific set of conventions so that you do not have to have lots of configuration files.  This makes it easier if you follow the convention.  In this way, it is an "opinionated" language also because it proposes there is a right way to do things in a Rails way.  It also subscribes to the D.R.Y (don't repeat yourself) principle making it less prone to repetition and simpler to implement.  All these things make Rails a way to rapidly deploy a web application without a lot of overhead.
