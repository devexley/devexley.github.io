      Having taken the test, my results were Concrete Sequential: 12, Abstract Sequential: 44, Abstract Random: 44, Concrete Random: 20.
      
    </p>
      Concrete and Abstract refer to perceptual qualities.  Concrete is more grounded and perceives through the 5 senses and sees the world for what it is. Abstract is more in tune with imaginative, intutive, and conceptualization.  
    <p>
      Sequential and Random refer to ordering abiilities for organizing information.  Sequential is indicative of organizing information in a linear, logical fashion. People who are sequential are often planners  Random, on the other hand, chunks information in no particular order.  This quality often indicates impulsivity and unplanned.

        Everyone is a mix of these to some degree but usually have a preference.  So for me I am very high on the abstract perceptually and less concrete.  This does not surprise me as I tend to think of the unseen more than the seeen. 
    </p>

      From reviewing the information, I neeed to improve on being more concrete and sequential.  I believe taking notes, being diligent trying to learn things in a linear style, and having more structure would help.  In phase 0, this has been my biggest struggle.  Trying to learn the material in an orderly fashion and retain it without missing chunks of information.  I also need to work on having more of a growth mind-set and take failures as a chance to learn more.  I should attempt what I don't know to learn more and steer away from a fixed-mindset.
